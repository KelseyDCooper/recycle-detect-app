# WORK IN PROGRESS 

An Android application to detect items before you throw them away and reduce the volume of recyclables that end up in the trash can. It determines when the trash can is in use, and assesses if the items in question are recyclable using [Tensorflow](https://www.github.com/tensorflow) for real-time object detection.
