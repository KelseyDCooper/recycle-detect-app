# WORK IN PROGRESS 

An Android application to detect recyclable items before you throw them away in order to reduce the volume of improperly sorted waste.

It starts automatically when your trash can is in use and determines if your items are recyclable using [Tensorflow](https://www.github.com/tensorflow) for real-time object detection.
